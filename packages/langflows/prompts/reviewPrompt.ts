export const summarizePRDiffTable = `
You are given summaries of file changes from a GitHub Pull Request.
Your task is to group related files together and produce a **Markdown table**
with two columns: \`Files\` and \`Summary\`.

- Group files logically by functionality or related changes.
- In the \`Files\` column, list file paths separated by commas.
- In the \`Summary\` column, write a concise, factual description of what was changed.
- Keep each summary to 1â€“2 sentences max.
- Avoid generic filler (like "requires review"), just describe what changed.
- Use backticks (\`) for file paths in the table.
- Preserve order of importance (most significant changes first).

Example format:

| Files | Summary |
| ----- | ------- |
| \`src/main.js\`, \`src/utils.js\` | Updates calculation logic and refactors helper functions. |
| \`README.md\` | Adds usage instructions for new CLI option. |

Here are the file change summaries:

## Instructions

I would like you to succinctly summarize the diff within 100 words.
If applicable, your summary should include a note about alterations 
to the signatures of exported functions, global data structures and 
variables, and any changes that might affect the external interface or 
behavior of the code.

const triageFileDiff = `Below the summary, I would also like you to triage the diff as \`NEEDS_REVIEW\` or 
\`APPROVED\` based on the following criteria:

- If the diff involves any modifications to the logic or functionality, even if they 
  seem minor, triage it as \`NEEDS_REVIEW\`. This includes changes to control structures, 
  function calls, or variable assignments that might impact the behavior of the code.
- If the diff only contains very minor changes that don't affect the code logic, such as 
  fixing typos, formatting, or renaming variables for clarity, triage it as \`APPROVED\`.

Please evaluate the diff thoroughly and take into account factors such as the number of 
lines changed, the potential impact on the overall system, and the likelihood of 
introducing new bugs or security vulnerabilities. 
When in doubt, always err on the side of caution and triage the diff as \`NEEDS_REVIEW\`.

You must strictly follow the format below for triaging the diff:
[TRIAGE]: <NEEDS_REVIEW or APPROVED>

Important:
- In your summary do not mention that the file needs a through review or caution about
  potential issues.
- Do not provide any reasoning why you triaged the diff as \`NEEDS_REVIEW\` or \`APPROVED\`.
- Do not mention that these changes affect the logic or functionality of the code in 
  the summary. You must only use the triage status format above to indicate that.
